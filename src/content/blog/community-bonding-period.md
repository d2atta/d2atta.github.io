# Community Bonding Period

After the contributors for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 were announced, the GSoC team organized a series of "welcome talks" and engaging activities, including the "GSoC Contributor Summit." These events were not only enjoyable but also incredibly helpful in clarifying various aspects of the GSoC process. It was a wonderful opportunity to interact with fellow contributors and gain insights into the journey ahead.

In addition to the central GSoC events, my organization, DBpedia, arranged a special meetup for all the contributors involved this year. This gathering was an incredible experience as it allowed me to meet other contributors, exchange ideas, and learn about the diverse projects everyone is working on. The sense of community and shared enthusiasm was truly inspiring.

During the community bonding period, I dedicated my time to thoroughly understanding DBpedia and its ecosystem. This phase was crucial for setting myself up for the coding period, which is set to begin next week. I delved into various open-source tools and resources, which will be instrumental in my project.

As I progress through the project, I am committed to documenting my learnings, experiences, and project status here on this blog. I believe that this documentation will not only help me reflect on my work but also provide valuable insights to others who might be interested in similar endeavors.

Thank you for following along!
