This is the second week(3-7th June) of the coding period of GSoC where the main
aim was to deploy the DIEF framework locally to understand the changes needed
to increase the coverage of Hindi mappings.

## Virtuoso Client Setup

DBpedia uses virtuoso client for hosting it RDF triples, thus setting up the
Virtuoso client is a crucial step for working with the DBpedia Extraction
Framework locally. Virtuoso is a high-performance, scalable, and secure RDF
database that is often used with DBpedia for managing and querying the
extracted data.

This week, I started by installing Virtuoso on my local machine. The process
involved:

1. **Downloading and Installing Virtuoso**: I followed the official
   documentation to download and install the latest version of Virtuoso.
2. **Configuration**: Configured Virtuoso to work with DBpedia's data model and
   ensure it could handle the extraction and querying processes effectively.
3. **Testing the Setup**: After installation, I ran a series of tests to
   confirm that Virtuoso was running correctly and could interact with the
   DBpedia data.

## Local Deployment of DIEF

With Virtuoso set up, the next step was to deploy the DBpedia Extraction
Framework (DIEF) locally. This involved:

1. **Cloning the Repository**: I cloned the DBpedia Extraction Framework
   repository from GitHub to my local development environment.
2. **Installing Dependencies**: Installed all necessary dependencies and
   libraries required by the framework.
3. **Configuring the Environment**: Set up the local environment configurations
   to ensure that the framework could connect to the local instance of
   Virtuoso.
4. **Running Initial Tests**: Executed initial extraction tests to verify that
   the local deployment was functioning as expected.

## Mapping for Hindi

One of the primary goals for this week was to add mappings for the Hindi
language. This involved:

1. **Understanding Existing Mappings**: Studied the existing mappings for other
   languages to understand the structure and requirements.
2. **Creating New Mappings**: Developed new mappings tailored for Hindi. This
   included handling specific language constructs and ensuring that the
   mappings accurately reflected the data.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Tested the new mappings to ensure they worked
   correctly with the extraction framework and validated the output to verify
   the accuracy of the extracted data.

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the week, I encountered several challenges:

1. **Configuration Issues**: Initially faced some configuration issues with
   Virtuoso. Solved these by consulting the documentation and seeking help from
   the DBpedia community.
2. **Mapping Complexity**: The complexity of creating accurate mappings for
   Hindi was higher than expected. Addressed this by iterating on the mappings
   and validating them with sample data.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensured that the local deployment was
   optimized for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Learnings and Next Steps

This week has been highly productive and educational. Some key learnings
include:

1. **Deepened Understanding of Virtuoso**: Gained a deeper understanding of how
   Virtuoso works and how to configure it for optimal performance.
2. **Proficiency in DIEF**: Improved my proficiency in working with the DBpedia
   Extraction Framework and its components.
3. **Language Mapping**: Developed skills in creating and testing
   language-specific mappings, with a focus on Hindi.

Next steps include:

1. **Refining Mappings**: Continue refining the Hindi mappings based on
   feedback and additional testing.
2. **Expanding Coverage**: Start working on mappings for additional datasets
   and languages.
3. **Community Engagement**: Engage more with the DBpedia community to gather
   feedback and collaborate on solving challenges.

Stay tuned for more updates on my GSoC journey as I continue to contribute to
the DBpedia project!
