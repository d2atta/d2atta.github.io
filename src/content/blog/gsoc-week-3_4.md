This is the third and forth week(17-21st June) of the coding period of GSoC where the main aim was to configure different existing extractors and mappings for Hindi.

## Table of Contents

## Configured Extractors

We've configured several extractors, including:

- RedirectExtractor: For managing redirects.
- HomepageExtractor: To extract homepage URLs.
- DisambiguationExtractor: For handling disambiguation pages.
- TopicalConceptsExtractor: To identify and extract topical concepts.
- ImageExtractorNew: To handle image extraction.
- Added Mappings for Different Infoboxes. Mappings for various infoboxes have been added, enhancing our ability to organize and categorize the data effectively.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Server Setup for Viewing Statistics
   We encountered an issue with setting up the server to view statistics. However, this challenge was swiftly resolved with the assistance of another GSoC student, Meti. Collaborating on this solution has been a great example of teamwork and mutual support.

## Action Items

1. Configure the Abstract Extractor for Hindi
   We aim to configure the abstract extractor to support Hindi. This will involve tailoring the extractor to handle the nuances of the Hindi language.

2. Increase Mapping Coverage of Hindi Mappings
   In line with our mentors' suggestions, we will work on manually adding mappings to increase the Hindi coverage. This will be a significant step towards enhancing the inclusivity and richness of our dataset.
