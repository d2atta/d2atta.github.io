## Contributer@DBpedia (GSoC'24)

I am thrilled to announce that I have been accepted as a contributor for Google Summer of Code 2024 with DBpedia! This marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, and I am eager to dive into this incredible opportunity to contribute to Open-Source.

## My Project

This summer, I will be working on "Hindi DBpedia Chapter". This project is
particularly exciting because it involves creating a Hindi Chapter for the
existing DBpedia. My work will help enhance DBpediaâ€™s capabilities and
contribute to the broader mission of making structured data more accessible and
useful.
