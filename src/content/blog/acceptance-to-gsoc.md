## Contributer@DBpedia (GSoC'24)

I am thrilled to announce that I have been accepted as a contributor for Google
Summer of Code 2024 with DBpedia! This marks a significant milestone in my
journey as a developer, and I am eager to dive into this incredible opportunity
to contribute to Open-Source.

## My Project

This summer, I will be working on "Hindi DBpedia Chapter". This project is
particularly exciting because it involves creating a Hindi Chapter for the
existing DBpedia. My work will help enhance DBpediaâ€™s capabilities and
contribute to the broader mission of making structured data more accessible and
useful.

## Process of Application

The application process for GSoC was both challenging and rewarding. I began by
researching various organizations and projects that aligned with my skills and
interests. DBpedia stood out due to its commitment to structuring Wikipedia
content into a highly accessible knowledge base. After selecting DBpedia, I
started working on my proposal, which involved outlining the goals, timeline,
and technical approach for my project. I received valuable feedback from
mentors and community members, which helped me refine my proposal before the
final submission. The approval of my project was a thrilling moment, marking
the beginning of this exciting journey.

## Timeline

The project is structured into several phases over the summer:

- **Community Bonding Period (May 1 - May 26):** During this time, I will
  familiarize myself with the DBpedia community, clarified project goals, and set
  up the necessary development environment.
- **Phase 1 (May 26 - July 12):** Focused on setting up the basic
  infrastructure for the Hindi DBpedia Chapter, including initial data extraction
  and mapping processes and adding specific mappings for Hindi.

- **Midterm Evaluation (July 12):** Submission of the partial completed project
  to GSoC for mid-eval.

- **Phase 2 (July 12 - August 19):** Enhanced the Neural data extraction methods,
  worked on integrating Hindi content with DBpedia, and began testing the initial
  outputs.

- **Phase 3 (August 19 - August 26):** Finalized the integration, performed
  extensive testing, and prepared the final documentation and report.

- **Final Submission (August 26):** Submission of the completed project to GSoC
  for final evaluation.
